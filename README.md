# Alzheimer_Detection-
Alzheimer’s Disease Detection using Transfer Learning focuses on identifying Alzheimer’s at an early stage using brain MRI images. The project uses pre-trained deep learning models such as VGG16, ResNet50, or MobileNet to extract important features from MRI scans, reducing training time and improving accuracy.
