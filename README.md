# Alzheimer’s Disease Detection Using Transfer Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Alzheimer’s Disease Detection using Transfer Learning is an AI-based medical imaging project designed to automatically detect and classify Alzheimer’s disease from brain MRI images. The system leverages powerful pre-trained deep learning models to identify structural brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s, enabling early and accurate diagnosis.
